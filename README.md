# CRAP: Compiler Replacement for Assembling Programs

A language model fine tuned to emit raw Linux x86_64 ELF binaries _directly_ as a hex string. No compiler, no assembler, no linker: the model writes the finished machine code byte for byte, and the bytes run.

Should you use this instead of a compiler? Sure, it works. It's also useless.

```
"Generate a Linux x86_64 binary that prints 'hello world'."

  xxd -r -p > a.out && chmod +x a.out && ./a.out
  hello world
```

The model cards have the usage examples, recommended sampler flags, eval methodology and known limitations. Start there if you only want to run it.

## What's in this repo

- **`binary-gen/`**: the ELF and Mach-O builder. Constructs minimal binaries
  from a description. Generation and execution are here; the evaluation and
  inspection commands stay private.
- **`demo/`**: a small app for poking at the model interactively.
- **`reference/`**: hand written assembly and C used to work out what the
  minimal binaries should look like.
- **`crapped/`**: the browser demo; see its README for build instructions.
- **`paper/paper.pdf`**: the technical report.

The Python demo runs on a small public inference shim.

## Local development

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

The top level `pyproject.toml` only keeps tooling consistent across the
workspace; it doesn't ship anything.

### Git hooks

`pre-commit` runs `ruff` (format + lint) and `pyright` before every commit,
including the per-package checks:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```
